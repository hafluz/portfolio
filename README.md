## **[Project 1: How Green is the Energy we use?](https://github.com/hafluz/energy_data)**
### ðŸŒŽ Creating a dashboard for tracking global low-carbon energy consumption and its impact on CO2 emissions.

**Overview:**
The main goal of the project was to create a tool to track the growth and evolution of low-carbon energy throughout the world. Additionally, the aim was to explore the data further and test a few hypotheses regarding the use of clean energy sources and their relationship with overall CO2 emissions and other key economic indicators.

**Skills:** Data exploration, Data preparation and wrangling, Setting KPIs, Descriptive statistics, Data visualization.  
**Tools:** SQL, BigQuery, Python, Pandas, Numpy, Tableau, Google Cloud.  
**Key Findings:** Evolution of low-carbon energy use in the world, greenest energy grids worldwide, correlation between green energy consumption and low CO2 emissions.

## **[Project 2: Tsunamis Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/hafluz/tsunami_exploratory)**
### ðŸŒŠ Exploratory data analysis of Global Historical Tsunami events using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Folium.

**Overview:**
The main goal of this project was to better understand patterns within the historical tsunami dataset, detect outliers or anomalous events and find interesting relationships among the variables. Additionally, there was an effort to extract insights regarding the most common set of events that ultimately led tsunamis to occur, and how they affected the dimensions and the aftermath of the events themselves.

## **[Project 3: ChatGPT Sentiment Analysis on Twitter](https://github.com/hafluz/sentiment_analysis)**
### ðŸ’¬ Twitter Sentiment analysis of ChatGPT involving data scrapping and employing natural language processing models to identify, extract, and classify the overall sentiment towards ChatGPT.

**Overview:**
The goal of this project was to conduct a sentiment analysis using 5 different natural language processing (NLP) models to get insights into the overall sentiment towards ChatGPT on Twitter. A sentiment analysis identifies the emotions in the context of a tweet, extracting subjective information from the original data and classifying whether the underlying sentiment is positive, negative or neutral. Thus, providing a better understanding of the current social sentiment regarding the subject.

**Project Repository:** [`github.com/hafluz/sentiment_analysis`](https://github.com/hafluz/sentiment_analysis)  
**Python Code:** [`chatgpt_sentiment_analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/hafluz/sentiment_analysis/blob/main/Project_3_Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb)  
**Skills:** Web scraping, Data preparation and cleaning, Exploratory data analysis, Statistics, Data Visualization, Data Querying and extracting insights.     
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplorlib, Seaborn, NLTK, VADER, RoBERTa, Transformers Pipeline, TextBlob, WordCloud      
**Key Findings:** Combining and comparing the models' different outputs, the overall sentiment regarding ChatGPT was found to be mostly neutral but slightly more skewed towards positive emotions. The opinions included in the tweets, on the other hand, were very skewed towards subjectivity as opposed to facts.
