## **[Project 1: How Green is the Energy we use?](https://github.com/hafluz/energy_data)**
### ðŸŒŽ Creating a dashboard for tracking global low-carbon energy consumption and its impact on carbon emissions.

**Overview:**
The main goal of the project was to create a tool to track the growth and evolution of low-carbon energy throughout the world. Additionally, the aim was to explore the data further and test a few hypotheses regarding the use of clean energy sources and their relationship with overall CO2 emissions and other key economic indicators.

**Python Code:** [`energy_python.ipynb`](https://github.com/hafluz/energy_data/blob/main/energy_python.ipynb)   
**SQL Queries:** [`energy_sql_scripts.sql`](https://github.com/hafluz/energy_data/blob/main/energy_sql_scripts.sql)    
**Dashboard:** [`Tableau dashboard`](https://public.tableau.com/views/GlobalEnergyConsumptionDashboard/HOWGREENISTHEENERGYWEUSE?:language=pt-BR&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)  
**Skills:** Data exploration, Data preparation and wrangling, Setting KPIs, Descriptive statistics, Data visualization.  
**Tools:** SQL, BigQuery, Python, Pandas, Jupyter, Tableau, Google Cloud.  
**Key Findings:** Evolution of low-carbon energy use in the world, correlation between green energy consumption and low CO2 emissions.

## **[Project 2: Tsunamis Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/hafluz/tsunami_exploratory)**
### ðŸŒŠ Exploratory data analysis of Worldwide Tsunami historical events using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Folium.

**Overview:**
The main goal of this project was to better understand patterns within the historical tsunami dataset, detect outliers or anomalous events and find interesting relationships among the variables. Additionaly, there was an effort to extract insights regarding the most common set of events that ultimately led tsunamis to occur, and it affected the dimensions and the aftermath of the events themselves.

**Python Code:** [`tsunami_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/hafluz/tsunami_exploratory/blob/main/Project_2_Tsunami_Exploratory_Data_Analysis_v2.ipynb)    
**Skills:** Data understanding, Data preparation and cleaning, Exploratory data analysis, Data Visualization, Data Querying and extracting insights.  
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, Google Cloud  
**Key Findings:** Identified patterns within the historical data, detected outliers events and found interesting relationships among the variables.
